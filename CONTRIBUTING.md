When making commits, please use clear and descriptive commit messages to convey the nature of your changes. Here are some common commit message types and their meanings:

- `feat:` A new feature has been added.
- `fix:` A bug has been fixed.
- `docs:` Changes have been made to documentation.
- `style:` Changes have been made to the code's style or formatting.
- `refactor:` The code has been refactored without changing its functionality.
- `test:` Changes have been made to unit tests or test cases.
- `chore:` Changes have been made to the build process or other non-code related tasks.

For example:
